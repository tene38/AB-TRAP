# Notes

The measurements script failed multiple times while running because of
timeouts. I'm not sure if the same happened to the authors. This means that
the measurements didn't actually take 20 mins per model, but were much
shorter, because of timeouts.

This directory contains valid measurements for most of the later models.
`../results2` contains valid results for the baseline and the first model.
